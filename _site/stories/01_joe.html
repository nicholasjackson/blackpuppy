  <p>My name is Joe I am the brother of little black puppy,  when I first met Raehaneh I was living in an old shed by a furniture factory.  There was no food, it was wet, dirty and since I was the largest of the litter it was down to me to try and defend my family.</p>

<h2 id="the-fight">The fight</h2>
<p>I was less than 6 months old when I got into the fight, I was bitten so badly that my skill was fractured and it did not take long for the infection to set in.  If it had not been for Raehaneh I would have certainly have died.  My family could not really help me after all dogs make great companions but not great vets, and we had no money for medical care.</p>

<p>Thankfully this nice lady found a fantastic veterinary surgery and paid for me to get some help. I had to undergo a terrible operation and was very sick but the skill of Dr Gorman who operated on me was amazing and I survived.</p>

<p>My Dr Gorman told me that Raehaneh was going to help my brothers and sisters too, we went in the dog ambulance back to the furniture factory so they could come to the hospital with me for treatment.  When my brother spotted me he rushed over and we went back to the hospital together.  I love Monty and I was so happy to be reunited with him.</p>

<p>The nice lady who rescued me bought me and Monty a plane ticket to London, we are going to live in West London, I hear it is a really nice place and that I am going to have a nice warm bed and plenty of good food.  We are really excited, I will miss my brothers and sisters but they are safe now and we are off to live with a family who will love us.</p>
