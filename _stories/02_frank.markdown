Frank was only about 8 months old when he was found and for such a young boy he has undergone a lot, and yet he still has the sweetest temperament. Besides the rubber band around his neck which cut into his flesh, he was likely hit by a car to end up with a fractured hip.  

## Rescue
Luckily for frank he was rescued by Krista and with the help of Jaiya animal rescue in Shanghai and Dr Beck and Stone, he will make a fill recovery.

## Rehoming
Thankfully someone with a kind heart adopted Frank and has managed to give him the home he has always wanted.
