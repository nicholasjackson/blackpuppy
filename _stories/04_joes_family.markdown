Including Joe and Monty there were twelve dogs living rough in the furniture factory, the cold of Bejing in the winter is something you would not like to experience if you have no home.  The hospitality towards strays is neither welcoming.

It was lucky for them that Rae just happened to be working next door and spotted their poor disabled sister.

## The Rescue
She also noticed a poor old man, Mr. Li, and a pack of twelve other dogs near an old building. On closer inspection she noticed that one dog had a massive facial infection, and the entire pack looked ragged, while Mr. Li was feeding them whatever little food he could scrape up.

Rae was feeding the dogs during her stay in Beijing, and left China a few days later, but the image of the little black puppy dragging her two broken hind legs across the street did not leave her.

During a stopover in London, and with the help of her vet, Dr. Paloma Diaz Carretero, she decided to contact Doctors Beck & Stone to arrange a rescue mission. Veterinarians were dispatched to the scene, and a grim report came back. The little black puppy had somehow disappeared, despite having only two functioning legs, and it was decided to focus on the rest of the pack, starting with the dog with the massive facial infection, Joe, and his brother, Monty. Mr Li cooperated in the rescue mission, and both Joe & Monty were rescued, treated, cleaned, vaccinated, neutered, fed, and boarded at Doctors Beck & Stone.

## Welfare
During discussions with Mr. Li it became clear that a lot more responsible pet ownership education is needed in China. The first issue for people to understand is that we must control the animal population in a humane manner, through neutering, to end the needless suffering caused by overpopulation of pet animals. The second issue is for people to understand and acknowledge other animals’ life on our planet and treat them with the care, love and respect they deserve, as they have served us well, are an important part of humans’ life and their sufferings and ultimately distinction will be detrimental to all the humans.

## Rehoming
Thankfully there are some wonderful people in Bejing one of which is Chris Bardon who runs the Little Adoption Shop, with support from The Little Black Puppy Charity he took in the remainder of the dogs and has now managed to successfully rehome most of them.  It is the Little Adoption Shop that forms the main focus for The Little Black Puppy Charity we are determined to raise enough money to ensure it's survival.
